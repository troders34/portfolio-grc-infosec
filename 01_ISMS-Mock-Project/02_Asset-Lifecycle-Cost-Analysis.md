# Asset Lifecycle Cost Analysis
> Asset Lifecycle Cost Analysis (LCA) is a process of calculating total cost associated with an asset from purchase to disposal.

# Features in Asset LCA
Asset LCA accounts all expenses including:
* Procurement and deployment
* Licensing and subcription fees
* Energy consumption
* Maintenance and upgrades
* End-of-life disposal or recycling

## Stages of Asset Lifecycle Cost Analysis
1. Planning
	- defining requirements
	- budgeting for new assets
2. Acquisition
	- purchasing or leasing
	- deployment costs
3. Operation
	- daily usage
	- energy and staffing costs
4. Maintenance
	- upgrades
	- patches
	- warranty
	- support
5. Disposal
	- decommisioning
	- recycling
	- replacement

## Example in Implementing Asset LCA
| Asset Type | Planning and Acquisition | Operation | Maintenance | Disposal |
| ---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| on-premise servers | setup, purchase | electricity, cooling | upgrade, repair | decommisioning |
| computers | purchase | electricity, helpdesk | occasional repair | recycling |
| software license | purchase | renewals, compliance | support updates | license transfer |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Benefits of Implementing Well LCA
1. Better decision-making
2. Stronger financial forecasting
3. Improved asset value

## Key Features in LCA Tools
* Comprehensive cost modeling
	- capture both CAPEX and OPEX
* Integration capabilities
* User-friendly dashboard
	- enabled in many teams with minimum effort to learn the system
* Reporting and analysis
* Scenario planning

## Procedure to Calculate Assets LCA
1. Identify cost categories
2. Gather data
3. Apply cost modeling tools
4. Compare scenarios

## Tips in Implementing Asset LCA
* start small
* collaborate across teams
* invest in training
* define success metrics

## Challenges in LCA and Method to Overcome Them
* *data gaps. |*
**solution: automate discovery with integrated tools.**
* *stakeholder resistance. |*
**solution: share success stories showing savings.**
* *hidden costs. |*
**solution: use tools that flag risks automatically.**

## Abbreviation
```
CAPEX = Capital Expenditure
OPEX  = Operating Expenses
LCA   = Lifecycle Cost Analysis
