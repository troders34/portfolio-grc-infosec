### NIST CSF Core
_It `organizes cybersecurity values at highest level`, meaning that it mentions the core values served in most undestandable language or term._

_More information about CSF Core is mentioned in **Appendix A. CSF Core**._

### Simple Explanation of CSF Core
_This explanation is cited from NIST CSF 2.0 Section 2. Introduction to the CSF Core._

**CSF Core: Govern (GV)**

_=== an organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored ===_
- provides the most fundamental cybersecurity outcomes an organization needs to achieve on first action.
- integrates critical Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) strategies.
- informs the procedure in implementing other five Functions.

**CSF Core: Identify (ID)**

_=== an organization's current cybersecurity risks are understood ===_
- alligns an organization's priority efforts to its mission needs, risk management strategy, and assets.
- informs cybersecurity risk management efforts under all six Functions.
- informs cybersecurity-related improvement opportunities that reflects an organization's business value.

**CSF Core: Protect (PR)**

_=== safeguards to manage an organization's cybersecurity risks are used ===_
- supports ability to secure assets from unwanted cyberattacks.
- supports transformation of any available resources into cybersecurity advantageous.

**CSF Core: Detect (DE)**

_=== possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed ===_
- enables immediate discovery and analysis of any potential cyberattack events.
- assists successful incident response and recovery activities.

**CSF Core: Respond (RS)**

_=== actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken ===_
- contains effects or damages of cybersecurity incident.
- discusses incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication.

**CSF Core: Recover (RC)**

_=== assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored ===_
- supports immediate cybersecurity troubleshooting.
- enable necessary communication during recovery efforts.

### CSF Core as a Circle
- should be addressed concurrently.
- Functions are named to summarize the cybersecurity contents.
- Categories are related to cybersecurity outcomes extracted from Functions.
- Subcategories are defined into more technical and management outcomes from Categories.

**About NIST CSF 2.0 Core Table**
- order of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories of the Core is not alphabetical, instead it is intended to resonate most with operationalizing risk management within an organization.
- numbering of Subcategories is intentionally not sequential.

### Abbreviation
- NIST = National Institute of Standards and Technology
- CSF  = Cybersecurity Framework
- IoT  = Internet of Things
- IT   = Information Technology
- OT   = Operational Technology
- ICT  = Information and Communications Technology
